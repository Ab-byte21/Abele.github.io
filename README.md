##  About Me

I began my academic journey at **Highline College**, where I developed a strong foundation in:

- Java programming  
- Algorithms and data structures  
- Statistics and problem-solving  
- Academic support and peer tutoring  

I later transferred to the **University of Washington Tacoma** to continue my CS degree and pursue **Business Analytics** as a minor.

Coming from a rural **Ethiopian village** to the U.S. education system taught me **resilience, adaptability, and the power of education**. I’m motivated to use technology to:

- Bridge **access gaps**  
- Build tools that support smarter decision-making  
- Empower communities through **innovation, data, and mentorship**  

In my free time, I enjoy:

- Helping other students with coding and software tools  
- Studying data analytics and AI  
- Building side projects to strengthen my technical skills
